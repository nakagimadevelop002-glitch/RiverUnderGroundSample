Hey, thank you so much for purchasing my Salamander!
This asset contains X rigged, textured and animated Salamander

This project supports 3 render pipelines (Built-in, URP and HDRP), so I had to make some concessions and tidy up the project accordingly. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Import:
Check all the files you need and the correct pipeline folder. uncheck the two other pipeline folder to proprely import it

Animation:
This model is supplied with 4 animations:
1 walking cycle, 1 idle cycle, 2 transitions

You can find all the animations directly inside the ___ fbx file contained in the "Meshes" folder
I also added an animator example (Inside the "DemoAnimator" folder) that loops between all animations.

Materials and textures:
1 material made up of 3 textures (2048px):
- Albedo
- Metallic Smoothness
- Normal map

(plus the HDRP MaskMap)

You will also find a demo scene featuring the Salamander and the animator

Thank you again, if you have any questions feel free to contact me by email or Instagram
